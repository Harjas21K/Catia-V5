# CATIA V5 Projects and Drawings

Welcome to my CATIA V5 repository! This space is dedicated to sharing the various models, drawings, and mini-projects I've created as part of my learning and exploration with CATIA V5.

## 📌 About

This repository serves as a central place to store and showcase my personal CATIA V5 work. While most of the content here consists of small-scale designs, part modeling, assemblies, and general applications, you’ll also find a few mini-projects sprinkled throughout.

> **Note:** Larger or more complex projects that I've worked on professionally or academically are not included here.

## 🛠️ Focus Areas

- 🏎️ **Automotive-Inspired Parts** (e.g. suspension components, brackets, mounts)
- 🧰 **General Mechanical Components** (e.g. bolts, gears, housings)
- 🧱 **Practice Models** from tutorials or self-designed parts
- 🧪 **Mini Projects** that combine multiple parts into small assemblies
